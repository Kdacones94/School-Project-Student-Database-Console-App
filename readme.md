This project exists to demonstrate competency in with Object Oriented Programming Concepts by applying them to real-world technical challenges. Competency will be achieved when the student can build a solution for a console application. The console will enter student information into the database for school administrators. The console has to be able to retrieve student information like name, StudentID, major, etc. The project will utilize an existing system already in production. The console will only be accessed using the terminal and console output.
