This project exists to demonstrate competency in with Object Oriented Programming Concepts by applying them to real-world technical challenges. Competency will be achieved when the student can build a solution for a console application. The console will enter student information into the database for school administrators. The console has to be able to retrieve student information like name, StudentID, major, etc. The project will utilize an existing system already in production. The console will only be accessed using the terminal and console output.

## Getting Started

> > The project might have multiple branches: `master`, `hotfix` which can be explained here

* `master` contains aggregate code of all branches
* `hotfix` contains code under development

Other details that need to be given while starting out with the project can be provided in this section. A project structure like below can also be included for the big projects: 

/
└── libstud/
    └── path/
        ├── path.hpp
        ├── path-io.hpp
        └── ...

└── libstud/
    └── url/
        ├── url.hpp
        ├── url-io.hpp

### Tools Required

All tools required go here. You would require the following tools to develop and run the project:

* A text editor or an IDE (like IntelliJ)
* Mention the other tools required for the project 


### Installation

All installation steps go here.

* Installing a particular tool
  * Steps to complete it
  
* Installing another tool

## Development

This section is completely optional. For big projects, the developement strategies are not discussed. But for small projects, you can give some insight to people. It has 2 benefits in my opinion:

1. It's a way to give back to the community. People get to learn from you and appreciate your work
2. You can refer the README in future as a quick refresher before an interview or for an old project to check if it can help you in your currect work

### Part 1: Heading

#### Step 1: Subheading

* Mention the steps here
  * You can also have nested steps to break a step into small tasks
  
#### Step 2: Subheading

* Mention the steps here.
  * You can also have nested steps to break a step into small tasks

For details now how everything has been implemented, refer the source code

### Part 2: Heading

* Mention the steps here

## Running the App

Steps and commands for running the app are to be included here

* Example steps:
  ```
    Example command
